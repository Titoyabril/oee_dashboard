# Phase 1: Dash/Plotly Integration - Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated Dash/Plotly framework into the existing Django OEE Dashboard project. This phase establishes the foundation for converting the HTML/Canvas dashboard to a modern Dash-based solution.

## Branch
- **Branch Name**: `dash-plotly-celery-conversion`
- **Base**: Built on top of working HTML dashboard from `clean-dashboard-start`

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Dash Application (`oee_analytics/dash_app.py`)
- Created main Dash app using `DjangoDash`
- Implemented test components:
  - Live KPI card with auto-updating values
  - Interactive line chart with OEE trend
  - Real-time updates using `dcc.Interval` (5-second refresh)
- Added callbacks for dynamic updates
- Prepared structure for Celery integration

### 2. Django Integration
- **URL Routing**: Added `/dash-dashboard/` endpoint
- **View**: Created `dash_dashboard` view in `views.py`
- **Template**: Created `dash_dashboard.html` with `{% plotly_app %}` embedding
- **App Registration**: Updated `apps.py` to import dash_app on ready

### 3. Configuration
- django-plotly-dash already configured in `settings.py`
- Channels support enabled for WebSocket communication
- ASGI configuration ready for real-time updates

## Testing Results
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Dash dashboard accessible at http://localhost:8000/dash-dashboard/
- ✅ Auto-refresh working (5-second intervals)
- ✅ Callbacks functioning properly
- ✅ No console errors or warnings

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `oee_analytics/dash_app.py` - Main Dash application
2. `oee_analytics/templates/oee_analytics/dash_dashboard.html` - Template for embedding

### Modified Files:
1. `oee_analytics/apps.py` - Added dash_app import
2. `oee_analytics/urls.py` - Added dash-dashboard route
3. `oee_analytics/views.py` - Added dash_dashboard view

## How to Test Phase 1

1. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Navigate to: http://localhost:8000/dash-dashboard/

3. You should see:
   - Header: "OEE Dashboard - Dash/Plotly Version"
   - Test KPI card showing OEE percentage (updates every 5 seconds)
   - Line chart showing OEE trend over 10 hours
   - Both components update automatically

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
Phase 2 will focus on converting the three main dashboard sections:
1. Top KPI Row - Convert to Dash KPI cards
2. Middle Section - Convert charts and tables to Plotly
3. Bottom Machine Rail - Create custom Dash components

## Technical Notes
- Using `DjangoDash` for seamless Django integration
- Bootstrap styling enabled via `add_bootstrap_links=True`
- Prepared callback structure for Celery task integration
- Interval component ready for real-time data streaming

## Dependencies Verified
- Django 5.0.7
- django-plotly-dash
- plotly
- channels
- pandas
- numpy
