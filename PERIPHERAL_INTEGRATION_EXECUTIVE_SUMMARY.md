- [ ] **Historian priorities** (PI first? Wonderware? Both?)
- [ ] **IoT sensor protocols** (MQTT only? Add CoAP/LoRaWAN?)
- [ ] **Phase 1-2 budget approval** (4-5 week commitment)

### Technical Decisions (Engineering Team)
- [ ] MES connector: REST vs. SOAP vs. OData
- [ ] Historian backfill: Real-time vs. batch vs. hybrid
- [ ] IoT normalization: Separate pipeline vs. unified
- [ ] Export formats: CSV + Parquet vs. add JSON/Avro

## Conclusion

The OEE Analytics platform has a **strong foundation** for peripheral data integration. With **~60% of infrastructure already built**, the remaining development focuses on specific connector modules and import utilities.

**Recommended Path Forward:**
1. **Approve Phase 1-2** (MES/ERP + Historian + IoT) - 5 weeks
2. **Start with MES connector** (highest business value)
3. **Parallel track:** Historian backfill development
4. **Defer Phase 3-4** until Phase 1-2 validated

**Estimated Time to Value:**
- **3 weeks:** MES schedule sync operational
- **5 weeks:** Historian backfill + IoT sensors live
- **9 weeks:** Full feature set with export APIs
