## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment

**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours

#### Step 1: Deploy MQTT Cluster

```bash
cd docker/compose

# Generate certificates
./certs/generate_certs.sh

# Start MQTT cluster
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mqtt-cluster.yml up -d

# Verify
docker ps  # Should show emqx-node1, emqx-node2, emqx-node3, haproxy
curl http://localhost:18083  # EMQX dashboard (admin/public)
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] 3 EMQX nodes running
- [ ] HAProxy stats accessible (port 8404)
- [ ] MQTT broker accessible on port 8883
- [ ] Dashboard shows cluster status

#### Step 2: Deploy TimescaleDB

```bash
# Start TimescaleDB
docker-compose -f docker-compose.timescaledb.yml up -d

# Wait for database to be ready
sleep 10

# Initialize schema
docker exec -i oee-timescaledb psql -U oeeuser -d oee_analytics < timescaledb/init/01_init_timescaledb.sql

# Verify
psql -h localhost -U oeeuser -d oee_analytics -c "SELECT version();"
psql -h localhost -U oeeuser -d oee_analytics -c "SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname='timescaledb';"
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] PostgreSQL running
- [ ] TimescaleDB extension loaded
- [ ] Hypertables created (telemetry, events)
- [ ] Continuous aggregates created
- [ ] PgAdmin accessible (optional)

#### Step 3: Deploy Redis

```bash
# If not in compose files
docker run -d --name oee-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine redis-server --appendonly yes

# Verify
redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Redis running
- [ ] Persistence enabled
- [ ] Accessible on port 6379

### Phase 2: Edge Gateway Deployment

**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes (depends on number of gateways)

#### Step 1: Generate Edge Gateway Certificates

```bash
cd docker/compose/certs
source generate_certs.sh

# For each edge gateway
generate_client_cert edge_SITE01-LINE01
generate_client_cert edge_SITE01-LINE02
generate_client_cert edge_SITE02-LINE01
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Client certificate files created
- [ ] Private keys have 600 permissions
- [ ] Certificates signed by CA

#### Step 2: Test Ansible Connectivity

```bash
cd ../../ansible

# Test SSH connectivity
ansible edge_gateways -m ping

# Expected: All hosts return SUCCESS
```

**Troubleshooting**:
- If fails: Check SSH keys, IP addresses, firewall
- Verbose: `ansible edge_gateways -m ping -vvv`

#### Step 3: Deploy to Staging First

```bash
# Dry run
ansible-playbook -i inventory/staging.yml playbooks/deploy_edge_gateway.yml --check

# Deploy
ansible-playbook -i inventory/staging.yml playbooks/deploy_edge_gateway.yml

# Verify
ansible-playbook -i inventory/staging.yml playbooks/health_check.yml
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Deployment completes without errors
- [ ] Service running: `systemctl status oee-edge-gateway`
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] MQTT connection established
- [ ] OPC-UA connection established

#### Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy one site at a time for safety
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_edge_gateway.yml --limit site01_gateways

# Verify before continuing
ansible-playbook playbooks/health_check.yml --limit site01_gateways

# If successful, deploy to remaining sites
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_edge_gateway.yml --limit site02_gateways
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] All edge gateways deployed
- [ ] All services running
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] MQTT messages being published

```bash
cd tests

# Set environment variables
export TEST_MQTT_BROKER=localhost
export TEST_TIMESCALE_HOST=localhost
export TEST_REDIS_HOST=localhost
# ... (see INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md for full list)

# Run framework tests
py -m pytest test_framework_validation.py -v

# Run integration tests
py -m pytest tests/integration/ -v -s

# Run load tests
py -m pytest tests/load/ -v -s
```

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] OPC-UA → MQTT → DB latency <1s
- [ ] Load test: 1000 msg/sec sustained
- [ ] p95 latency <2s, p99 <5s
- [ ] Zero data loss during fault storm

#### Step 2: Performance Validation

```bash
# Run TimescaleDB performance tests
py -m pytest tests/integration/test_timescaledb_performance.py -v

# Check metrics
curl http://<edge-gateway-ip>:9100/metrics
```

**Targets**:
- [ ] TimescaleDB write rate >10k inserts/sec
- [ ] TimescaleDB query time <100ms
- [ ] CPU usage <50% under normal load
- [ ] Memory usage <80%
- [ ] Queue size stable (not growing)

#### Step 3: End-to-End Validation

```bash
# 1. Trigger OPC-UA data change on PLC
# 2. Observe MQTT message in EMQX dashboard
# 3. Query TimescaleDB for data

psql -h localhost -U oeeuser -d oee_analytics -c "
SELECT * FROM telemetry
WHERE machine_id = 'SITE01-LINE01'
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Data appears in database within 1 second
- [ ] Data quality = 192 (good)
- [ ] Timestamp accurate
- [ ] Metrics match PLC values

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Alerting

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

#### Step 1: Configure Dashboards

```bash
# Access Grafana
# http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)

# Import dashboards
# - EMQX cluster metrics
# - TimescaleDB performance
# - Edge gateway fleet health
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] MQTT message rate visible
- [ ] Database write rate visible
- [ ] Edge gateway status visible
- [ ] Certificate expiry dates visible

#### Step 2: Configure Alerts

```bash
# Edit Prometheus alert rules
vim docker/compose/prometheus/alerts.yml

# Key alerts:
# - MQTT broker down
# - TimescaleDB down
# - Edge gateway down
# - Certificate expiring <30 days
# - High queue size (>5000)
# - High memory usage (>85%)
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Alert rules loaded in Prometheus
- [ ] Test alert fires correctly
- [ ] Notifications received (email/Slack)

#### Step 3: Schedule Automated Tasks

```bash
# Certificate rotation check (weekly)
0 2 * * 0 cd /path/to/ansible && ansible-playbook playbooks/rotate_certificates.yml

# Health check (daily)
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/ansible && ansible-playbook playbooks/health_check.yml

# Backup (daily)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/ansible && ansible-playbook playbooks/backup_restore.yml
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Cron jobs scheduled
- [ ] Logs being generated
- [ ] Reports being saved
